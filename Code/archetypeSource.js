Competitors become more visible. For those whose chart benefits from Wood energy, this is a period of genuine forward momentum; for those whose chart is already Wood-heavy, the excess can produce restlessness, overcommitment, or difficulty consolidating what's already been started.`,  // [PRO]

The gift is reliability. When you assess something, the assessment is accurate. When you commit to something, the commitment holds. What you build carries the mark of this quality in ways that outlast the moment it was made.

The cost is also structural. The same quality that produces reliability produces friction: environments, relationships, and opportunities that can't hold the standard experience you as difficult before they experience you as valuable. The precision doesn't modulate for readiness. It arrives at full force.

      what: `庚 is the blade, the axe, the harvest tool — the Yang Metal that cuts, defines, and restructures. Classically described as 金之阳 (the Yang of Metal), it is the energy of forced decision and structural clarity. The classical texts describe 庚 as the force that "cuts away what is complete to reveal what remains." Where Wood grows and Earth accumulates, Metal defines. It is the atmosphere of "what was vague becomes clear, often by force; what was finished gets cut away."`,  // [FREE · DM intro + absent energy card]
      represents: `Major restructuring in environments — organizational, governmental, relational. Forced decisions on matters that were being kept ambiguous. Endings of cycles that had been quietly completed but not yet formally closed. Competitive pressure increasing. The need for decisive action in career and personal matters. Contracts and agreements being written, enforced, or terminated.`,  // [FREE · DM intro + absent energy card]
      liunian: `When 庚 energy enters your luck cycle or annual pillar, the environment demands clarity and decision. Things that were vague get defined — by choice or by circumstance. Relationships and situations that were being kept in comfortable ambiguity get resolved, often sharply. Restructuring happens around you and possibly to you. This period rewards those who can act decisively and punishes those who avoid decisions past the deadline. For charts that benefit from Metal, this brings productive definition and momentum-clearing restructuring; for those already Metal-heavy, the excess can produce conflict, unnecessary cutting of things not yet finished, or a bluntness that damages what it was meant to sharpen.`,  // [PRO]

      concentrated: `The evaluating and cutting force is relentless. Everything gets assessed; everything gets cut to shape. Highly productive for those who benefit from defined edges and clear decisions. Damaging for those who needed more time or more flexibility — the cutting happens regardless of readiness. Classical texts warn 金旺伤木 (strong Metal injures Wood) — when Metal is excessive, it cuts down what was still growing, including what should have been given more time. The danger is cutting too early, deciding too harshly, and removing things that needed more development before they were ready to be shaped.`,  // [FREE · Elemental Nature card]
      open: `The ability to make definitive decisions, set clear limits, and close what is finished becomes genuinely harder. Things that are complete don't get properly ended. Ambiguity lingers past the point where it serves anyone. Relationships and projects that should close continue because there is no cutting force available to bring them to a clean conclusion. The environment feels gentler but more cluttered — less decisive, more unresolved, more drained by the energy required to maintain what should have ended.`,  // [FREE · Elemental Nature card]
      catalyst: `Activate it by making the decision you have been deferring. This energy specifically rewards categorical commitment: the contract signed, the option closed, the position stated clearly, the boundary set.

      desc: `The seasonal pattern for 庚: Metal is most fully expressed when Fire is present and engaged. Not because Fire adds anything to the structure — the capability was complete before Fire arrived — but because Fire specifies what the structure is an instrument for.

The classical principle from 穷通宝鉴: 金逢火炼方成器 — raw metal becomes a shaped instrument through contact with fire. The transition is from 素材 (formed, capable, unspecified raw material) to 成器 (an instrument defined for a specific purpose). The capability doesn't change. What changes is the direction.

In practice: periods when Fire energy is strong — summer months, Fire-dominant years, relationships or career contexts that carry genuine warmth, urgency, or a target worthy of the edge — bring the specific challenge, person, or context that specifies where the precision should land. Without this contact, the evaluative apparatus remains formed but unspecified: accurate, capable, and running on whatever is available rather than on what it was built for.

Note: 庚 Metal prefers 丁 Fire (the contained flame — the forge, the purposeful heat) over 丙 Fire (the open blaze, the burning sun). The forge shapes. The wildfire consumes. When Fire contact arrives through genuine purpose and directed warmth, the Forging Season is productive. When it arrives through excessive pressure or uncontrolled intensity, the metal loses temper rather than gains it.

The 2 AM version: "I know what I am. I still don't know what I'm for." The Forging Season is when that question gets answered — not once, but each time Fire provides a worthy target.`,  // [PRO]
