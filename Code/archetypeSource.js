If you're positioned to initiate, this is the energy that provides momentum. If you're not ready to move, the pressure to start still arrives. Career opportunities emerge suddenly. Competitors become more visible. For those whose chart benefits from Wood energy, this is a period of genuine forward momentum; for those whose chart is already Wood-heavy, the excess can produce restlessness, overcommitment, or difficulty consolidating what's already been started.`,  // [PRO]

The specific trap: more beginnings accumulate than can ever be finished, and the backlog slowly becomes its own weight.`,  // [FREE · Elemental Nature card]

Health matters tend to surface — both as concerns requiring attention and as an opportunity for genuine restoration. Long-term investments begin paying quiet dividends. Relationships deepen rather than expand. This is not a period for dramatic moves; it is a period for developing what is already growing.

Overthinking, rumination, and carrying others' emotional weight characterizes the excess state. The Field grows weeds as readily as it grows crops when there's no selectivity about what gets tended.`,  // [FREE · Elemental Nature card]

The environment lacks the quiet, sustained presence that allows things to develop at their natural pace — which means the depth of development that slow nourishment produces simply never arrives.

Use Metal energy (boundary, definition, cutting) to create filtration — allowing only the right material into the nurturing field.

          open: `The evaluation is present, but it doesn't lead. You enter a room and something observes — notes what holds and what doesn't — but that observation doesn't arrive as a completed assessment before engagement has begun. The evaluative quality exists as an undercurrent rather than a first fact. What's different: you can be more present to what's actually in the room before the read closes. The precision functions; it just no longer runs ahead of everything else. The world arrives before the verdict does.`,
          tested: `The world evaluates back. That's the specific texture when authority energy is dominant: the precision runs as it always does, but now something is running a read on you at the same time. An institutional lens — an external standard — operates in parallel with your own. If the external standard is genuine, this sharpens rather than compresses: there's something real to measure against. If it isn't, you know before the conversation has properly started. What changes is that the assessment is no longer one-directional. You are inside a system that is also assessing you, and that fact is part of what you're evaluating.`,
          pure: `No dominant Ten God is shaping the deployment of this energy. The evaluative capacity runs as its essential self — not directed outward by a wealth configuration, not grounded by a dominant resource pull, not filtered through a relational or authority register. What arrives is precision without a predetermined channel. The world is a set of things to be assessed, and the question of what to do with those assessments is genuinely more open than it is for configurations where a dominant force has already specified the answer. This is not a weakness. It is the unconstrained form: the precision is free to find the target that actually deserves it, rather than the one a dominant configuration has already selected.`,
          rooted: `Resource energy supporting the Metal means the evaluation doesn't arrive alone — it arrives backed. Assessments form slower here and land harder once they do: the structural support that generates stability also generates weight. The world arrives not just as something to be cut but as something to be understood at depth, relative to what persists. There is a groundedness in how you encounter things — you don't need to immediately act on what you've assessed, and the holding capacity is real. Where this creates friction: the same structural weight that makes your verdicts reliable makes it harder to move toward things that aren't yet proven. You are well-positioned for durable work. You are less well-positioned for commitments that need to be made before confidence has fully formed.`,

The assessment runs, but verdicts don't close with the same force — positions stay open longer than they should, and the evaluative capacity can circle a question without landing somewhere that holds.

The care is real; the precision is real. What's missing is the weight that makes the conclusion feel final.`,
          tested: `The stuck is specific: you know what's right, and the structure wants something else. Not wrong — differently calibrated, optimized for criteria your standard wasn't built around. The temptation is to push the assessment through anyway because it's accurate. The cost is structural: the framework grants standing, and standing determines what gets heard. What holds you back is the gap between maintaining the verdict and operating inside the system that lets you act on it. Most of the time you find a way to manage both. The times you can't are the ones that cost something.`,
          pure: `The pure configuration produces a specific stuck point: the precision is operational and accurate, but without a dominant directive force, the question of which valid conclusion to act on first doesn't have a built-in answer. Multiple assessments can coexist in equal standing — each accurate, none obviously prioritized. The decision machinery works. The orientational function, which would normally be supplied by a dominant wealth or authority configuration, has to be consciously constructed rather than structurally given. The stuck is subtle: you are not lacking clarity. You may be lacking the frame that tells you which clarity matters most right now.`,
          rooted: `The structural weight that makes your assessments reliable is the same force that makes revision expensive. A conclusion formed with strong resource backing doesn't revise easily — not because it can't be corrected, but because the same grounding that produced it resists being overturned by anything less than genuinely heavy counter-evidence. The stuck pattern: you identify that something may need to change, the internal evaluation runs, and it runs longer than the situation requires. By the time you've reached full confidence in the revision, the window for acting on it has sometimes closed. The other form: you hold a position past its usefulness not out of stubbornness but out of structural integrity. Same property; different cost.`,

Everything you encounter gets evaluated through a standard that doesn't bend to convenience. This is not a choice you made. The Metal dominant quality is structural: it was already running before preference had a chance to form.

The gift is reliability. When you assess something, the assessment is accurate. When you commit to something, the commitment holds. What you build carries the mark of this quality in ways that outlast the moment it was made.

The cost is also structural. The same quality that produces reliability produces friction: environments, relationships, and opportunities that can't hold the standard experience you as difficult before they experience you as valuable. The precision doesn't modulate for readiness. It arrives at full force.

      what: `庚 is the blade, the axe, the harvest tool — the Yang Metal that cuts, defines, and restructures. Classically described as 金之阳 (the Yang of Metal), it is the energy of forced decision and structural clarity. The classical texts describe 庚 as the force that "cuts away what is complete to reveal what remains." Where Wood grows and Earth accumulates, Metal defines. It is the atmosphere of "what was vague becomes clear, often by force; what was finished gets cut away."`,  // [FREE · DM intro + absent energy card]
      represents: `Major restructuring in environments — organizational, governmental, relational. Forced decisions on matters that were being kept ambiguous. Endings of cycles that had been quietly completed but not yet formally closed. Competitive pressure increasing. The need for decisive action in career and personal matters. Contracts and agreements being written, enforced, or terminated.`,  // [FREE · DM intro + absent energy card]
      liunian: `When 庚 energy enters your luck cycle or annual pillar, the environment demands clarity and decision. Things that were vague get defined — by choice or by circumstance. Relationships and situations that were being kept in comfortable ambiguity get resolved, often sharply. Restructuring happens around you and possibly to you. This period rewards those who can act decisively and punishes those who avoid decisions past the deadline. For charts that benefit from Metal, this brings productive definition and momentum-clearing restructuring; for those already Metal-heavy, the excess can produce conflict, unnecessary cutting of things not yet finished, or a bluntness that damages what it was meant to sharpen.`,  // [PRO]

      concentrated: `The evaluating and cutting force is relentless. Everything gets assessed; everything gets cut to shape. Highly productive for those who benefit from defined edges and clear decisions. Damaging for those who needed more time or more flexibility — the cutting happens regardless of readiness. Classical texts warn 金旺伤木 (strong Metal injures Wood) — when Metal is excessive, it cuts down what was still growing, including what should have been given more time. The danger is cutting too early, deciding too harshly, and removing things that needed more development before they were ready to be shaped.`,  // [FREE · Elemental Nature card]
      open: `The ability to make definitive decisions, set clear limits, and close what is finished becomes genuinely harder. Things that are complete don't get properly ended. Ambiguity lingers past the point where it serves anyone. Relationships and projects that should close continue because there is no cutting force available to bring them to a clean conclusion. The environment feels gentler but more cluttered — less decisive, more unresolved, more drained by the energy required to maintain what should have ended.`,  // [FREE · Elemental Nature card]
      catalyst: `Activate it by making the decision you have been deferring. This energy specifically rewards categorical commitment: the contract signed, the option closed, the position stated clearly, the boundary set. Don't hedge — the productive use of this energy is definitiveness. One clear decision is worth ten careful ones that stay provisional. Outcome: clarity replaces ambiguity and frees up the energy that was being spent maintaining the unresolved situation. What was clouded becomes specific. Direction becomes actionable.`,  // [FREE · teaser  /  PRO · full analysis]

      desc: `The seasonal pattern for 庚: Metal is most fully expressed when Fire is present and engaged. Not because Fire adds anything to the structure — the capability was complete before Fire arrived — but because Fire specifies what the structure is an instrument for.

The classical principle from 穷通宝鉴: 金逢火炼方成器 — raw metal becomes a shaped instrument through contact with fire. The transition is from 素材 (formed, capable, unspecified raw material) to 成器 (an instrument defined for a specific purpose). The capability doesn't change. What changes is the direction.

In practice: periods when Fire energy is strong — summer months, Fire-dominant years, relationships or career contexts that carry genuine warmth, urgency, or a target worthy of the edge — bring the specific challenge, person, or context that specifies where the precision should land. Without this contact, the evaluative apparatus remains formed but unspecified: accurate, capable, and running on whatever is available rather than on what it was built for.

Note: 庚 Metal prefers 丁 Fire (the contained flame — the forge, the purposeful heat) over 丙 Fire (the open blaze, the burning sun). The forge shapes. The wildfire consumes. When Fire contact arrives through genuine purpose and directed warmth, the Forging Season is productive. When it arrives through excessive pressure or uncontrolled intensity, the metal loses temper rather than gains it.

The 2 AM version: "I know what I am. I still don't know what I'm for." The Forging Season is when that question gets answered — not once, but each time Fire provides a worthy target.`,  // [PRO]
